Library of Congress Bagit format
================================

Archivematica allows the ingest of the
`Library of Congress Bagit <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt>`_ format. Users
can ingest both zipped and unzipped bags. Bags must be packaged in accordance
with the Bagit specification.

* To ingest a zipped bag, user selects transfer type "Zipped bag" from the
  dropdown menu in the transfer tab of the Dashboard. Do not add the directory
  that the zipped bag is in from the browse dialog, just select the zipped file
  (.zip). Note that you cannot add a new title to the zipped bag transfer, but
  you can add an accession number.
