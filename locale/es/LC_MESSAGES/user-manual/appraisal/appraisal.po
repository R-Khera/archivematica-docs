"archivists to decide which files from transfers should become SIPs and "
"how these files should be arranged within the SIP. It includes features "

"for connecting files to finding aids created in ArchivesSpace. The "
"Arrange a SIP from Backlog feature, found in previous versions of "
"Archivematica, also has moved to the Appraisal tab (see :ref:`Arrangement"
