"Archivematica anticipates that a number of different types of errors can "
"occur during processing. Some of them will result in processing being "
"halted and the transfer or SIP being moved to the failed directory in the"
" file browser. For others, processing can continue: for example, a "
"normalization failure is reported and the user is given the opportunity "
"to continue processing the SIP."
