"During a digitization project, it is common to create a master digital "
"object (such as a high-resolution TIFF) as well as an access or service copy"
" of the object (such as a lower-resolution JPG). Archivematica can recognize"
" the relationship between the master and access or service versions of the "
"object and use them to generate a DIP."
