"Archivematica uses a directory tree structure to store AIPs. The tree is "
"based on AIP UUIDs, which are 16-digit alphanumeric unique universal "
"identifiers. Each UUID is broken down into a manageable 4-character chunk, "
"or \"UUID quad\". Each quad represents a directory. The first four "
"characters (the first UUID quad) of the AIP UUID will compose a subdirectory"
" of the AIP storage. The second UUID quad will be the name of a sub "
"directory of the first, and so on. The last four characters (the last UUID "
"quad) are used to create the leaf of the AIP store directory tree, and the "
"AIP with that UUID resides in that leaf."
