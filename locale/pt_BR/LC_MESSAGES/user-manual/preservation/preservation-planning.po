"The Format Policy Registry (FPR) is a database which allows Archivematica "
"users to define which actions Archivematica should take on a particular file"
" format - for example, how Archivematica should normalize a JPEG file for "
"long-term preservation. This is called a format policy, and it defines the "
"tools, rules, and commands that Archivematica will use to complete the "
"desired preservation action."

" In addition, you can maintain local rules to add new formats or customize "
