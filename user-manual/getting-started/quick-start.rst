Archivematica Quick-Start Guide
===============================

.. quick-start-intro

Archivematica is a free and open-source digital preservation system that is
designed to maintain standards-based, long-term access to collections of
digital objects. Archivematica is packaged with the web-based content
management system AtoM for access to your digital objects.

This guide will get you up and running with Archivematica for testing purposes.
This is not a guide to install Archivematica for development or production - please
see :ref:`Installation <installation>` for full installation instructions.

Using the Sandbox
-----------------

Artefactual maintains an Archivematica sandbox at sandbox.archivematica.org with
the following credentials:

Username: demo@example.com
Password: demodemo

The sandbox is provided as an easy way to test the latest release of the Archivematica.
Please note that the website will automatically reset daily. Any packages that you
create will not be permanently saved. Additionally, there may be more than one demo
user logged-in at the same time, so you may see changes made by others while you
are using the software.

The demo site is publicly edited and unmoderated. For reasons of security, test
transfers are limited to Artefactual's provided sample data. Users who wish to
test using their own data may download the Vagrant box (described below) and test
locally.

Installing from Vagrant
-----------------------

It is possible to deploy Archivematica on a virtual machine. Users may want to do
this in order to test Archivematica's functionality using their own data. The
recommended way to install Archivematica on a virtual machine is with Ansible and
Vagrant.

To install and run Archivematica on a virtual machine, you must be somewhat
comfortable working on the command line.

# Install VirtualBox, Vagrant, and Ansible with the following commands::

sudo apt-get install virtualbox vagrant
sudo pop install -U ansible
