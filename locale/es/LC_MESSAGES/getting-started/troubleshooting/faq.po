"**What technical skills are required to install/maintain/operate "
"Archivematica?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-started/troubleshooting/faq.rst:9
msgid ""
"To install and maintain Archivematica successfully, you or someone in "
"your organization should be comfortable using and maintaining Linux-based"
" servers, logging in to the server and performing operations via the "
"command line. This individual should also be able to read and understand "
"and/or research errors in Linux based systems to assist with "
"troubleshooting."

"Operating Archivematica takes place in a web-based dashboard so an "
"archivist/librarian/curator does not necessarily need to have the same "
"skill set described above, so long as someone in their organization is "
"able to provide technical support. Some familiarity with `OAIS "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Archival_Information_System>`_ will "
"make Archivematica more intuitive to use but is not necessarily a "
"prerequisite."

msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-started/troubleshooting/faq.rst:28
msgid ""
"Archivematica is a complex piece of software with many dependencies, all "
"of which are open-source. Because of its complex, open-source nature, it "
"is not feasible to create a click-through executible file for "
"installation."

msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-started/troubleshooting/faq.rst:41
msgid ""
"The main purpose of Archivematica is to create standards-based, self-"
"documenting and system-independent archival information packages (AIPs). "
"An AIP includes a METS XML file with a robust PREMIS preservation "
"metadata implementation, and is packaged in the Library of Congress BagIt"
" format, which includes file manifests and information about the AIP "
"contents. The physical and logical structure of the AIP is described in "
"the METS structMap."

msgid "**Does Archivematica perform fixity checks?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-started/troubleshooting/faq.rst:50
msgid ""
"Archivematica generates checksums upon transfer of objects into the "
"system, and will verify those checksums before storing the AIP. It is "
"also possible to include :ref:`pre-existing checksums <transfer-"
"checksums>`, which Archivematica will also verify."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-started/troubleshooting/faq.rst:55

"To check fixity of AIPs in storage, Artefactual has written a separate "

msgid "**Is Archivematica a storage system?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-started/troubleshooting/faq.rst:61
msgid ""
"Archivematica is purposefully designed to be storage system agnostic, "
"leaving the door open for integration with a wide variety of existing "
"storage systems."

"**What is the Archivematica Storage Service and why is there a separate "
"application?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-started/troubleshooting/faq.rst:66
msgid ""
"The Archivematica Storage Service manages the storage and transfer source"
" locations for Archivematica installations. Our recommendation is for "
"each institution to have one or two administrators who are responsible "
"for managing the Storage Service and restrict access to only those "
"individuals. This is one of the reasons why it is maintained as a "
"separate application; another reason is so that multiple Archivematica "
"pipelines can be managed through one Storage Service."

msgid "**What is Archivematica’s capacity?  How much can it handle?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-started/troubleshooting/faq.rst:76
msgid ""
"Capacity is highly dependent on the resources allocated to the servers on"
" which the software is installed. Archivematica has been successfully "
"tested with SIPs of 100,000 files and with video files of several TB "
"each. No maximum size or number of files can be specified; Artefactual "
"works with clients to determine optimal use cases and workflows on a per-"
"institution basis."

msgid ""
"The `Archivematica AIP "
"<https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.6/user-manual"
"/archival-storage/aip-structure/#aip-structure>`_ consists primarily of "
"the ingested objects, any preservation masters generated during "
"processing, and technical, preservation, audit and descriptive metadata "
"encoded in METS XML. The METS file contains a robust PREMIS "
"implementation, including the Object, Event, Agent and Rights entities. "
"Dublin Core is supported as a descriptive metadata standard."

"**What kinds of preservation metadata is included in an AIP’s METS XML "
"file?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-started/troubleshooting/faq.rst:93
msgid ""
"Archivematica by default includes a very robust PREMIS implementation "
"which includes the Object, Event, Agent and Rights entities. Standard "
"Events include ingestion, fixity check, message digest calculation,  "
"unpacking, decompression, virus check, format identification, format "
"validation and normalization. The names of the software platform, the "
"organization and the logged-in user are captured as Agents for each "
"Event. Rights statements can be ingested as csv metadata or added by the "
"user via a metadata-entry template during processing."

msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-started/troubleshooting/faq.rst:103
msgid ""
"Yes! In Archivematica 1.6 an appraisal dashboard allows the user to "
"perform archival appraisal and arrangement activities on ingested files. "
"Submission documentation such as donor agreements, transfer forms and "
"accession records can be added to the SIP for preservation along with the"
" ingested digital objects, and are identified as submission documentation"
" in the preservation metadata in the AIP. In AtoM, an accessions module "
"allows users to record accessions, accruals and deaccessions and to "
"record information about appraisal and selection."

"**Why doesn't Archivematica have a module for providing access to digital"
" materials?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-started/troubleshooting/faq.rst:114
msgid ""
"In a manner of speaking, it does! It's called :ref:`AtoM <atom:home>` and"
" it is another open-source, freely available software application managed"
" and developed by Artefactual Systems. Archivematica and AtoM are "
"developed in conjunction with one another, and you can send access copies"
" from Archivematica to AtoM, while maintaining a link between your "
"preservation copies and the access copies. AtoM can also be used to "
"manage archival descriptions for all of your digital and analogue "
"material, so your users do not have to consult multiple systems to do "
"their research."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-started/troubleshooting/faq.rst:123
msgid ""
"We recognize that you may wish to use a different access system than "
"AtoM, which is why we have developed workflows with CONTENTdm, Islandora,"
" DSpace, Archivist's Toolkit and ArchivesSpace, for example. Other "
"integrations are possible; see the next question below."

"  In-depth contextual and content description can be done through an "

"All ingested content is automatically scanned for viruses and malware "
"using clamAV, a well-established open-source software tool that comes "
"bundled with Archivematica. Virus definitions are updated on a regular "

msgid "**What is normalization and how does normalization work?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting-started/troubleshooting/faq.rst:143
msgid ""
"Transcoding, or normalization, is automated through the use of "
"preservation commands entered into the `Format Policy Registry "
"<https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.6/user-"
"manual/preservation/preservation-planning/#fpr>`_. Bundled tools for "
"transcoding include ffmpeg, Inkscape, Ghostscript and ImageMagick. The "

"Errors are indicated in the Archivematica dashboard during processing. "
"Alerts can also be :ref:`emailed <email-config>` to designated users and "
"certain types of error reports  are retained in the Administration tab of"
" the dashboard. The corrective action  will depend on the nature of the "
