"The Format Policy Registry (FPR) is a database which allows Archivematica"
" users to define which actions Archivematica should take on a particular "
"file format - for example, how Archivematica should normalize a JPEG file"
" for long-term preservation. This is called a format policy, and it "
"defines the tools, rules, and commands that Archivematica will use to "
"complete the desired preservation action."

"When you install Archivematica, default formats, rules and commands are "

"Artefactual. Format policies will change as community standards, "
