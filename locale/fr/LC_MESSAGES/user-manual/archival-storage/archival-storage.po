"Archivematica uses a directory tree structure to store AIPs. The tree is "
"based on AIP UUIDs, which are 16-digit alphanumeric unique universal "
"identifiers. Each UUID is broken down into a manageable 4-character "
"chunk, or \"UUID quad\". Each quad represents a directory. The first four"
" characters (the first UUID quad) of the AIP UUID will compose a "
"subdirectory of the AIP storage. The second UUID quad will be the name of"
" a sub directory of the first, and so on. The last four characters (the "
"last UUID quad) are used to create the leaf of the AIP store directory "
"tree, and the AIP with that UUID resides in that leaf."
