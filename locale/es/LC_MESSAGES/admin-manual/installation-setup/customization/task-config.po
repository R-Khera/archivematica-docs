"Archivematica allows users to configure their MCP client(s) in order to "
"control whether or not output streams (stdout and stderr) from the client"
" scripts are captured and then passed from the task workers to the task "
"manager (the MCP server)."

"In the default configuration, these output streams *are* captured. In "
"this state, when a user clicks on the gear icon of a micro-service in "
"order to view the tasks that have run, each task representation will "
"contain a section entitled ``Standard streams`` which will contain a sub-"
"section entitled ``Standard output (stdout)`` containing the stdout from "
"the client script and another entitled ``Standard error (stderr)`` "
"containing the stderr."

"However, in some cases, serializing these output streams and moving them "
"around (*capturing* them) can have a non-trivial performance cost. (We "
"have measured a 6% reduction in processing time for some transfers when "
"output capturing is disabled.) Archivematica can be configured to avoid "
"paying this cost by disabling the capturing of these output streams. The "
"trade-off for doing this is that the stdout and stderr that documents the"
" running of a preservation task will no longer be stored in the database "
"and it will no longer be displayed in the tasks interface."

"In order to configure Archivematica to stop capturing output streams, one"
" must set the "
"``ARCHIVEMATICA_MCPCLIENT_MCPCLIENT_CAPTURE_CLIENT_SCRIPT_OUTPUT`` "
"environment variable to ``false`` before starting (or re-starting) the "
"MCP client process. The way that Archivematica environment variables are "
"set depends on the deployment method used. Please consult the relevant "
"documentation for your deployment method if you are interested in "
"disabling output capturing."
