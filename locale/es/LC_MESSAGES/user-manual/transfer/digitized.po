"During a digitization project, it is common to create a master digital "
"object (such as a high-resolution TIFF) as well as an access or service "
"copy of the object (such as a lower-resolution JPG). Archivematica can "
"recognize the relationship between the master and access or service "
"versions of the object and use them to generate a DIP."
