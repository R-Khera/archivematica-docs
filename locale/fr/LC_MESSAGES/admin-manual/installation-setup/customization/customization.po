"When Archivematica's MCP client (a Gearman worker) runs a client script in "
"order to perform a preservation task, e.g., normalizing a single file, that "
"client script may write data to standard streams, i.e., standard output "
"(stdout) or standard error (stderr). By default, the worker serializes those"
" outputs and sends them back to the MCP server (the task manager), at which "
"point they are stored in the database (the ``Tasks`` table). However, in "
"some cases these outputs may be quite large and the job of serializing and "
"moving them around can have a noticeable performance impact. For this "
"reason, Archivematica allows users to configure their MCP clients in order "
"to control whether or not these output streams are captured. See :ref:`Task "
"output capturing configuration <task-output-capturing-admin>` for more "
"details."
